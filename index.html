    <!-- Application Structure Plan:
        A single-page application (SPA) designed as a comprehensive slideshow. Each distinct content block from the source report is now its own "slide" within a main container.
        The top navigation bar provides quick jumps to the *first slide* of major sections (Home, About Me, Services & Pricing, Case Study, Lessons Learned).
        "Previous" and "Next" buttons allow sequential navigation through all individual slides.
        This granular slideshow structure ensures that all content is presented one piece at a time, mimicking a presentation flow, which enhances focus and understanding for an oral exam context. The navigation allows both broad section jumps and detailed step-by-step progression.
    -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        1.  Report Info: Project Title & Main Image (PDF Pg 1)
            Goal: Introduce the theme and Mauricio's brand.
            Viz/Presentation Method: Prominent hero section with title and image.
            Interaction: Visual.
            Justification: Strong initial visual impact and branding.
            Library/Method: HTML `<img>`, Tailwind CSS.
        2.  Report Info: "About Me" texts (Personal, Professional, Future Goals)
            Goal: Provide background information on Mauricio.
            Viz/Presentation Method: Each as a separate text card, acting as an individual slide.
            Interaction: Reading, slide navigation.
            Justification: Breaks down biographical information into digestible chunks.
            Library/Method: HTML paragraphs, Tailwind CSS.
        3.  Report Info: "Services Offered" list (PDF Pg 2)
            Goal: Detail the scope of services.
            Viz/Presentation Method: Bulleted list (`<ul>`) within a card, as a dedicated slide.
            Interaction: Reading, slide navigation.
            Justification: Presents comprehensive service list clearly.
            Library/Method: HTML, Tailwind CSS.
        4.  Report Info: Pricing details (PDF Pg 2 - R$120, R$70, $20)
            Goal: Inform about costs and allow comparison of main local currency packages.
            Viz/Presentation Method: Text list for all prices, plus a Chart.js bar chart comparing the R$120 and R$70 packages, as a dedicated slide.
            Interaction: Data visualization (chart), reading, slide navigation.
            Justification: Visual chart aids in quick comparison of key local prices; text for completeness.
            Library/Method: Chart.js, HTML, Tailwind CSS.
        5.  Report Info: Case Study narrative & VTT/Character Sheet Images (PDF Pg 3)
            Goal: Illustrate practical experience and problem-solving.
            Viz/Presentation Method: Each distinct part of the narrative (Initial Contact, Offer, Win-Win, Trust) gets its own slide, with integrated placeholder images where appropriate.
            Interaction: Reading, visual context from images, slide navigation.
            Justification: Storytelling approach broken into steps for clarity; images provide context.
            Library/Method: HTML paragraphs, `<img>` (placeholders), Tailwind CSS.
        6.  Report Info: "Lessons Learned" texts
            Goal: Share insights and professional philosophy.
            Viz/Presentation Method: Each key takeaway presented as a separate text card, acting as an individual slide.
            Interaction: Reading, slide navigation.
            Justification: Highlights key reflections and learnings in a focused manner.
            Library/Method: HTML paragraphs, Tailwind CSS.
        CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used.

                    <h3 class="card-subtitle">Personal Background</h3>
                    <p>"I was born in Rio de Janeiro on March 30th, 1988, and spent my childhood and teenage years in Barra da Tijuca. Growing up, my family wasn't wealthy and couldn't afford many things, so I learned the value of independence early on, starting work right after high school. My upbringing was quite strict and repressive, and I didn't experience much personal freedom until I became an adult. This background has definitely shaped my drive for self-reliance."</p>

                    <p>"Currently, I work as a professional tabletop RPG Gamemaster. My job involves creating and running online RPG sessions, which I find both challenging and incredibly rewarding. I'm also expanding my skills by studying to become a Traffic Manager and an AI chatbot salesperson, which I believe will open up new opportunities. My daily life is quite busy: I manage household tasks, prepare my game sessions, and handle the IT infrastructure for them.

                    <h3 class="card-subtitle">Initial Contact & Client Hesitation</h3>
                    <p>"Some time ago, I was contacted on Facebook by a player who was representing two other individuals. They were looking for a professional paid Dungeons & Dragons game. They contacted me because I was running a D&D campaign at that time. While we were talking, he explained that they were undecided about joining the group because they used to prefer campaigns with more exploration and combat rather than heavy roleplay."</p>

                    <h3 class="card-subtitle">The Offer and Negotiation</h3>
                    <p>"To address their hesitation, I believed a flexible solution was the best choice in that situation. So, I offered them a 20% discount for the first month if they decided to hire me. From my perspective, this was a reasonable offer, considering they were a group of three clients joining at once. During our negotiation, I set only one condition: all of them had to participate in the free Session Zero together. They agreed, and everything went very smoothly. As a great outcome, the game continued for several months, and they even renewed their subscription for a second campaign, this time paying the full price."</p>

From their perspective, they found the Game Master they were looking for, offering the playstyle they preferred, and they even received a discount for the first month. On my side, I successfully acquired three new clients at once, who later became loyal customers. Initially, they had some doubts about paying for a professional Game Master, but once they experienced the quality of my work, those doubts completely disappeared."</p>

                    <p>"This experience taught me the importance of adapting my service when needed, as long as it doesn't compromise my quality or professional integrity. It also showed me that a small sacrifice, like a temporary discount, can lead to significantly larger gains in the future. I believe I made the right decision by offering the discount; if I had insisted on the full price from the start, they might not have joined. Therefore, I will likely use this strategy again if I encounter a similar situation, because it truly works."</p>
